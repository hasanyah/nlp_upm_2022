Hideo Kojima Says He Worked on a Concept Similar to The Boys, and Wanted Mads Mikkelsen as the Lead

Death Stranding and Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima seemingly worked on a concept akin to Amazon's The Boys before putting it on hold for being too similar. Now that he's put that out there, leads on the TV show say they want the legendary developer to work on a tie-in game.

Kojima said he was "warming up" the project for a long time - with Hannibal's Mads Mikkelsen picked out as the lead in his mind - and was about to start it just as The Boys' first season was released. Sharing the concept on Twitter (below), Kojima said he stopped watching The Boys after episode three of the first season.
