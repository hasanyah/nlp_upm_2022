Destiny 2: Where Is Xur Today? Location and Exotic Items for June 24-28
The three small children stacked on top of one another wearing a trenchcoat, also known as Xûr, is now live in Destiny 2 for the weekend until next week's reset. If you're looking to get your some shiny new Exotic armor or weapons for your Guardian, look no further.

Each week, Xûr has a random assortment of Exotic armor, one for each Guardian class, as well as a random Exotic Weapon and an Exotic Engram available for purchase. In addition to his Exotic wares, he's got a random collection of Legendary weapons and armor to deck out your Guardians.

We've rounded up all the info on Xûr for the week including where to find Xûr, which Exotic weapons and armor are available, as well as which Legendary weapons you should pick up, either for PvE or PvP.

Where Is Xûr Today?
Xûr's location can be found at The Tower on June 24 through June 28. To reach him, travel to the landing point at The Courtyard and make your way to the Hangar. You'll find ol' snake-face chilling near the stairs at the back of the Hangar area.

Xûr has at least one good find this week. Check out this exotic gear!

Hunters and Warlocks both have good rolls this week, especially Hunters which have a maxed out stat roll of a very good exotic, Gwisin Vest. Warlocks have a very spikey roll of Eye of Another World to play around with. If you're a Titan hoping for a good exotic this week, I am so sorry.

Exotic Weapons

Hawkmoon - Exotic Hand Cannon

Paracausal Shot
Corkscrew Rifling
Alloy Magazine
Moving Target
Smooth Grip
Dead Man's Tale - Exotic Scout Rifle

Cranial Spike

Neither of these exotic weapons has a particularly amazing roll this week. I'd skip them both!

Frankly there aren't many Legendary Weapon standouts this week. The Tarantula is a good roll of a middling linear fusion rifle, and Gnawing Hunger has a decent roll for a weapon type that's fairly irrelevant in the current meta. Unless one of these speaks to you, I'd skip weapons this week.

Warlock Legendary Armor
For Warlocks, Xûr is selling the Xenos Vale IV set which includes:
Xenos Vale IV Gauntlets

16 Mobility
2 Resilience
9 Recovery
9 Discipline
2 Intellect
20 Strength
Total: 58
Xenos Vale IV Chest Armor

22 Mobility

Xenos Vale IV Leg Armor

16 Mobility

14 Recovery
9 Discipline
15 Intellect
7 Strength
Total: 63
Xenos Vale Bond

The Warlock armor this week is pretty rubbish! The only semi-decent roll is the boots, which have 63 overall stats and lots of mobility, so I'd...probably skip everything this week, if I'm being honest.

Titan Legendary Armor
For Titans, Xûr is selling the Shelter in Place set which includes:
Shelter In Place Gauntlets

12 Mobility
2 Resilience
17 Recovery
19 Discipline
10 Intellect
2 Strength
Total: 62
Shelter In Place Chest Armor

Shelter In Place Leg Armor

7 Mobility
17 Resilience
7 Recovery
7 Discipline
13 Intellect
9 Strength
Total: 60
Mark of the Shelter

Titans did marginally better than Warlocks and they've got a decent chest piece with high stats in all the right places and some gauntlets that would be good if they didn't have so many points in mobility. Everything else is pretty not great!

Hunter Legendary Armor
For Hunters, Xûr is selling the Took Offense set which includes:
Took Offense Gauntlets

12 Mobility
6 Resilience
9 Recovery
2 Discipline
17 Intellect
9 Strength
Total: 55

Took Offense Leg Armor

2 Mobility
10 Resilience
22 Recovery
9 Discipline
12 Intellect
8 Strength
Total: 63
Took Offense Cloak

A few good rolls for Hunters this week! The chest piece is great with 64 overall stats distributed across a few of the most important areas for our jumpy Guardians. The boots are also decent if you're trying to build a more durable Hunter.

That's a wrap on Xûr for this week, Guardians! What did you think of Empress Caiatl's run-in with Ghaul this week? Let me know your thoughts in the comments!
