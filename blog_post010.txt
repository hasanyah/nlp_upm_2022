Streamer Ibai Obliterates Twitch Record for Highest Concurrent Viewers
Twitch user Ibai Llanos has broken the streaming platform's record for the most concurrent viewers.

Llanos, who streamed the official live coverage of an online content creator-based boxing event, blew past the previous record of 2.4 million concurrents and set the new milestone of 3.3 million.

Twitch celebrated the record in a tweet (below), congratulating Llanos for the Barcelona-based La Velada del Año II event, which translates to The Evening of the Year. The event included five boxing matches between YouTuber Spursito, streamer AriGameplays, singer David Bustamante, and seven other content creators.

Llanos commented on the stream's success in his own series of tweets, saying it wasn't just a win for himself but for the entire Spanish and Latin American community. "Thanks to all the creators and artists for coming and making history," he added.

The previous record of 2.4 million concurrent users was set by Fortnite streamer TheGrefg last year during his skin collaboration reveal with the popular Battle Royale. David “TheGrefg” Martinez took the record from Tyler Blevins, better known as Ninja, who logged 635,000 concurrent viewers in 2018.
